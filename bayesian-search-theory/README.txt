Bayesian search theory is the use of Bayes' Theorem to find lost objects. It has been used to find planes crashed at sea, sunken submarines, missing people and more. Prior assumptions about the probability of finding the object in various locations are continually revised as the search proceeds.

In this project, we split an airplane's crash area into four parts, each having a probability of finding the plane in that segmented region. 

The probability of finding the plane in segment A is 0.2, probability of finding the plane in segment B is 0.6, segment C is 0.15 and 0.05 in D. 

There is also a 90% chance of finding plane if it's in that area and a 10% chance of not finding a plane if it's in that area and of course a 100% chance of not finding a plane in that area if it's not in that area. 

Keeping in mind it takes one day to search one area and priority search is determined by the area with the highest probability of finding the plane.
